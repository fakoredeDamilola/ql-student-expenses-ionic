    <p class="ion-padding-start ion-padding-end">
        The idea for this app, and inspiration was from previous companies and kinda modeled after expense reports ive had to do in the past.
        So the use is simple, and I wanted to utilize Ionic because it looks clean, very responsive, latest angular 11 etc.
        So as a Reports Manager(could be like a teacher or an actual manager for a department etc.) creates a Report, where he/she then goes and adds students to the report
        , who will recieve an exmail invite.  Then when those students add there expenses in their own profile through the app, its automatically associated with the expense reports they were added to.
