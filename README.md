# Ionic Angular Student Expenses Application

Code Once, Have Every Where!

Probably the best framework ever.

This app is built from Ionic Starter App, for the tabs, and Basic Look and Feel (BLAF).



***The <a href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli">Ionic CLI</a> is needed to run the application.

## For QL Student Expenses Runners
1. cd into server and `npm Install`
2. `npm start` to start server (should say running "Server listening on port 4000" ).
3. Open a new terminal window...
4. cd into client
5. run `npm i`
6. run `ionic serve` (will open up a page in browser).
7. Home Page has more instructions and overview.

* You should have 2 terminals running, one for the server, and one for the client.
